<h3>Highlights from my time teaching CS</h3>

<p>Being on Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50) staff has been incredibly rewarding.
I've now taught high school, college, and business school students.
I care deeply about making CS education accessible and promoting diversity, inclusion and belonging in the CS community.

    <li>I was part of a larger effort to translate CS50 materials into Spanish during the 2018 summer.
      Here's a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T383bsZ9yG64-aPhg2M6FM0-O">playlist</a> of CS50 en Español problem set walkthroughs, featuring me!</li>
      <li>More recently, as part of Harvard's Women in Computer Science club, I worked on a data
        visualization project with Jessica Edwards looking at diversity in SEAS (the School of Engineering
        and Applied Sciences). You can check it out <a href="https://veronicanutting.github.io/cs171-finalproject/#Introduction">here</a>!

         <li>For a fun video combining my interest in teaching and animation, watch the video below on the
           exciting topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXaHb9t9xbs&feature=emb_logo">sorting algorithms</a>! I made it freshman year as part of my application to be on
           CS50 staff.
